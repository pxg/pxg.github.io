Hi I'm Pete Graham,

I'm a fractional CTO, I help companies with their technical strategy and how to run high performing engineering teams. I've advised teams of all sizes improve their practices and delivery, from one developer to teams of over a hundred.

I've been involved in over fifty technical due diligence deals for major PE and VC companies through the work I do with [Seedcloud](https://www.seedcloud.com/). 

I was previously CTO at [Zero Deposit](https://www.zerodeposit.com) and [Roomix](https://roomix.com). My background is in software development. I'm particularly interested in the overlap between business, technology and customer experience.
