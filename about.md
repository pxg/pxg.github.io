I'm Co-founder & CTO at [Roomix](https://roomixdiy.com), I was previously CTO at [Zero Deposit](https://www.zerodeposit.com). My background is in software development and leading high performing product & engineering teams. I'm particularly interested in the overlap between business, technology and customer experience.
