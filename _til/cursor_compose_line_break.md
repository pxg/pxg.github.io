I've been enjoying using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) recently for writing code, or more often having it write code for me.

I prompt it most in compose mode and find it works best when you can be very descriptive in your prompts.

But without line breaks it can be difficult to review what you've written. It turns out you just need to hit `shift` and `enter` to insert a line break.
