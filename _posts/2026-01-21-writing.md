For years, I’ve enjoyed writing, but I’ve also struggled to make time for it regularly.

I’ve always found writing satisfying, in many ways, being able to write clearly is being able to think clearly.

After a number of failed attempts to start writing on a regular basis, I’ve decided to do things a bit differently this time:
1. Keep the articles short - to stop them becoming giant essays that never see the light of day
2. Write for myself as the initial audience - to prevent is become some huge self-marketing campaign I tire of
3. Make it easy and make it fun

I’ll be experimenting in different ways to keep it fun, but the first thing I’ve done is dust off my Bluetooth keyboard so I can write in different locations and not feel tied to my desk.
