"Hell Yeah or No" is something that I discovered from Derek Sivers. The idea is simple: when deciding whether to say yes to an opportunity, it should make you want to say "Hell Yeah!" If not, it should be a no.

As a rule of thumb, I think this is really good advice, only this week I had to remind myself of it.

Now I can think of at least one opportunity I turned down because it wasn't a "Hell Yeah", which probably would have ended up being a big success. I can also think of other opportunities which were a "Hell Yeah" at the point of deciding and definitely were not later. That said, I think the advice to follow your gut is generally solid.

Derek is an entrepreneur and a super interesting guy; he was the founder of CD Baby, an early internet start-up. I first came across him on [an interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast](https://sive.rs/2015-12-ferriss).
