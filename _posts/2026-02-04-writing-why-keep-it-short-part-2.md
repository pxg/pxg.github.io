With my writing attempts previously I’d often been overly ambitious then not manage to publish articles.

Occasionally I find partially written articles from years ago and I’m both impressed with what I’d written and disappointed that I never got it out into the world. Although sometimes the article weren’t finished because they are shit.

Keeping it short if a forcing function to:

1.  Get me to start writing
    
2.  Have me finish and publish the article
    

I’ve also been impressed by other people who have written short content which I’ve enjoyed such as Rui (who has stopped for now but I’d encourage to start again) and [Seth Goodwin](https://seths.blog).
