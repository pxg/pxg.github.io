With my writing attempts previously I’d often been overly ambitious then not manage to publish articles.

Occasionally I find partially written articles from years ago and I’m both impressed with what I’d written and disappointed that I never got it out into the world. Although sometimes the article weren’t finished because they are shit.

Keeping it short if a forcing function to:

1. Get me to start writing  
2. Have me finish and publish the article

I’ve also been impressed by other people who have written short content which I’ve enjoyed such as [Rui Peres](https://ruiper.es) (who has stopped for now but I’d encourage to start again) and [Seth Goodwin](https://seths.blog).
