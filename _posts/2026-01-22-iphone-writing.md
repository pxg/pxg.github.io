As I’ve previously written, [I want to do more writing this year](/writing/). As an experiment, I’m going to try writing in different locations. I don’t always want to carry a laptop, so I’ve been researching keyboards that work with iPhones. This may sound like madness, but it is something I’ve tried before and found surprisingly effective.

## iPhone Bluetooth Keyboards
Previously, I was using a [Keys to Go Bluetooth keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Keys-To-Go-Keys-to-Go/dp/B07W7K8MW2/), which [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2017/06/20/cool-tools-for-travel/) recommended on his podcast a long time ago. I rate these little keyboards, but sadly, some keys on mine have gone (no pun intended).

I decided to switch to the [MoKo Universal Foldable Keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07BNB6R7G) recommended by [Meri Williams](http://blog.geekmanager.co.uk/category/recommendations/kit/) instead. It weighs 176 grams, which is even lighter than the Keys to Go at 180 grams. It has some nice travel on the keys, but doesn’t have the iPhone-specific buttons (to get the home screen, etc), which is a shame but not the end of the world. Below is a photo of my cat Buzz with both keyboards, the Moko is on the left.

## iPhone Writing Apps
The next thing is which app to write in. I went to use SimpleNote for simplicity, but found the font was too small when using the keyboard, and it’s not easily adjustable.

I’ve now settled on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which works nicely but does have some slightly strange behaviour in terms of scrolling when typing. Also, I find you need to pump the font up on mobile, which also increases it on desktop, if you're using the same account.

## Focus Time
A weird side effect I noticed is that, because it’s actually more fiddly to multitask on an iPhone with an external keyboard, I find myself focusing on writing more than I do on a laptop. Makes me think that there’s a lot of potential in products that purposely limit distractions; this feels like it merits its own future article.
## What’s Next?
I’ll continue to update on how my writing experiments play out.

## Additional Information
After writing this, I was surprised to find that the iPhone also supports the [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/mxck3b/a/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-british-english), which I already own, so I'm planning to experiment with this as well.
