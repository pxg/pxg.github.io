description: Why using a laptop is still the best set-up for writing on train

I've been experimenting with [different iPhone writing set-ups](/iphone-writing-stand/), today I'm heading into London and I'm writing this on the train on my laptop for a couple of reasons.

Firstly I have the laptop with me as I plan to do some work between meetings, it's due diligence report writing which involves moving between multiple documents, fact checking and writing the actual report. This sort of task switching isn't great on an iPhone also many of the documents are PDFs which are a pain to read as it involves pinch zooming.

Secondly, the seats on Thameslink trains don't have tables. The advantage of a laptop is you can use it on your lap. Even with an ultra portable iPhone keyboard set-up I'd be unable to use it, unless I had some sort of bizarre device to strap the iPhone in front of my face. So for now I'll be sticking with my laptop or maybe it's time I invest in the Apple Vision Pro.
