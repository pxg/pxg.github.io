I want to establish habits such as getting up at the same time every weekday and having a regular meditation practice. These are things I know make me feel better, but I haven't been doing consistently recently.

I decided a habit tracker would be useful to help me achieve this. From a motivation point of view, being able to track things visually helps me stick to them. I tried a number of the apps on the App Store, but found they were overly complex and were very naggy about trying to sign me up to the premium version.

## The Solution
I decided to start with a simple solution of tracking in a Google Sheet. The sheet is very simple:
1. One day per row. [Highlight the current day](/TIL/highlight_today_in_google_sheets/). Hide all rows which aren't the current week
1. One habit per column
1. A checkbox for completing the habit that day

[Here's a copy of the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bEUeu5p7iGkimwKDx7WXOFmIVJ6-nmUu9iRRSOrr5h0/edit?gid=0#gid=0) if you want to try it.

## Why it Works
It works because it's simple yet effective. There are a few principles I've followed.
- **Build flexibility in**: one habit is "Getting up by alarm", not "Get up at 6 am", which lets me progressively move my getting up time earlier. It also means I can get up at a different time on the weekend
- **Habits are complementary**: if I get up early, I likely have time to meditate. If I don't drink the night before, I'm more likely to get up early. If I sleep well, I'm more likely to exercise, etc.
- **Habits focus on the positive**: I track Alcohol Free (AF) days, instead of days I drink
- **Habits are limited in number**: I have four habits for now, I think that might even be one too many, these are the ones I want to focus on
- **Habits are not overly prescriptive**: I want to make sure I exercise regularly. I have a marathon training plan in [Runna](https://www.runna.com/), which can be used for much more specific tracking, so I want to keep it simple here

I'll update later in the year on how I get on, let's see if I need to add a habit of writing consistently too.

## Additional Thoughts
If you're interested in forming and sticking to new habits I recommend [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) by James Clear.

I tried some other MacOS desktop widgets but had a similar experience to the iOS apps. One app I liked was [Geektool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/) to show the Google Sheet permanently on my desktop. It's a cool tool, but I did't really like how it looked. I could vibe code a frontend, but that really isn't necessary, as the sheet is helping me track things nicely.
